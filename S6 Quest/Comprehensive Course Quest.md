I'll review these CST308 most repeated questions and check if the answers are correct.

1. Which traversal technique will produce the sequence: 10, 30, 25, 60, 90, 75, 50? Answer: Post-order ✓ CORRECT
    
2. What is the time complexity of heap sort in the worst case? Answer: O(n log n) ✓ CORRECT
    
3. What is the worst case complexity of quick sort? Answer: O(n²) ✓ CORRECT
    
4. Which data structure is used to implement recursion? Answer: Stack ✓ CORRECT
    
5. Which traversal of a binary search tree gives the nodes in sorted order? Answer: In-order ✓ CORRECT
    
6. Which page replacement algorithm suffers from Belady's Anomaly? Answer: FIFO ✓ CORRECT
    
7. In the Dining Philosophers problem, what is the max number of philosophers that can eat simultaneously without deadlock? Answer: N - 1 ✓ CORRECT
    
8. The Banker's algorithm is used to... Answer: Avoid Deadlock ✓ CORRECT
    
9. Which of the following is NOT shared by threads of the same process? Answer: Stack ✓ CORRECT
    
10. If several elements are competing for the same bucket in the hash table, what is it called? Answer: Collision ✓ CORRECT
    
11. The data structure used in Breadth First Search is... Answer: Queue ✓ CORRECT
    
12. A system is said to be in a deadlock state when... Answer: Processes are waiting for resources held by each other ✓ CORRECT
    
13. Convert the infix expression (e.g., A+B_C-D^E^F) to postfix. Answer: Use operator precedence and associativity rules ✓ CORRECT (The actual conversion would be ABC_+DEF^^-)
    
14. Paging suffers from what type of fragmentation? Answer: Internal ✓ CORRECT
    
15. Given inorder and preorder/postorder, find the tree traversal or height. Answer: Use tree construction rules ✓ CORRECT
    
16. What is the number of edges present in a complete graph having n vertices? Answer: (n*(n-1))/2 ✓ CORRECT
    
17. In the worst case, how many comparisons are needed to search a singly linked list of length n? Answer: n ✓ CORRECT
    
18. Which cache mapping technique provides the fastest access time but has limited capacity? Answer: Direct mapping ✓ CORRECT
    
19. What is the prerequisite of binary search? Answer: Array must be sorted in ascending order ✓ MOSTLY CORRECT (More precisely: The array must be sorted, though not necessarily in ascending order)
    
20. What is the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h? Answer: 2^h - 1 ✓ CORRECT (This assumes height is measured from 1 at the root)
    
21. A hash table is a structure that... Answer: Maps keys to values ✓ CORRECT
    
22. Given a 32-bit virtual address and 4 KB page size, how many entries in the page table? Answer: 2^20 = 1,048,576 entries ✓ CORRECT
    
23. Which memory is closest to the CPU and provides fast access to frequently used data? Answer: Cache memory ✓ CORRECT (Specifically, L1 cache is closest)
    
24. If a process is executing in its critical section, no other process can enter theirs. This condition is? Answer: Mutual Exclusion ✓ CORRECT
    
25. Which algorithm is used to avoid deadlock? Answer: Banker's Algorithm ✓ CORRECT
    
26. What is a deadlock? Answer: A condition where processes wait indefinitely for each other's resources ✓ CORRECT
    
27. In BFS, which data structure is used? Answer: Queue ✓ CORRECT
    
28. Which of the following page replacement algorithms suffers from Belady's anomaly? Answer: FIFO ✓ CORRECT
    

All answers appear to be correct. For question 19, I'd just note that the array could be sorted in either ascending or descending order for binary search to work, as long as the implementation handles the comparison appropriately.
